# Königsberg Bridge Problem

The Königsberg Bridge Problem is a classic mathematical puzzle that gained historical significance and played a crucial role in the development of graph theory. It was first formulated in the early 18th century and remains an essential topic in the study of graph theory even today.

The problem is named after the city of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia), which was situated on both sides of the Pregel River, with two large islands in the river connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges. The challenge was to find a path that would cross each bridge exactly once and return to the starting point.

The problem was to determine whether it was possible to take a walk through the city, crossing each bridge exactly once and ending up back at the starting point. As people attempted to solve this problem, they realized that it was impossible to do so.

The Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler is credited with solving the Königsberg Bridge Problem in 1736. He introduced the concept of a "graph" to represent the city and its bridges, where the landmasses were represented as nodes, and the bridges were represented as edges connecting these nodes.

This repository will explore the problem and come up with a solution to this problem.
